## Exient Malta

#### Programmer | September 2014 - August 2018

Working exclusively on mobile titles, two new big titles were added to my lists: `F1` and `Lemmings`.

My first years saw me use mostly C++ and our in-house engine XGS to maintain and support `Angry Birds Go!`.
We successfully _ported_ `Angry Birds Go!` to be used with the Chromecast and the Apple TV.

Later I moved to the `F1` to help out with my speciallty: the Android integration.
Althought the developement was reaching its end, the Android platform was not performant and lack
some features. Being familiar with the Android ecosystem, I was responsible for putting the Android
version on par with its iOS counterpart.

After the release of `F1`, the `Lemming` project started and I was assign to it to work on the gameplace,
the first versions of the UI as well as integrating the third-party SDK that come with any mobile title:
ads, analytics, social, etc.

Having a strong shared code base, developing prototypes became easier and faster. After `Lemmings` a small
team was put together to R&D new ideas, me being the sole programmer.
From this `Cooking Merge` and `Cricket Kid` were made, a merging and a cricket game respectively.

Increasing model details, increase graphics details, change camera transitions, etc; we did
all we could to appear at the event.
